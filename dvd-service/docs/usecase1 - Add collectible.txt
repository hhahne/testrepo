A new collectible is added by interacting with a input boundary defined an interface, in turn implemented by an appropriate interactor on that interface.
The fields common to all Collectibles are defined in a request model object. Currently supported variables in the request model are: collectibleId, name, description and type. The type currently supports "Book" or "DVD" types of collcetibles.

Transactions look like: 
AddCollectible <RequestModel>

Alternative 1: 
If the transactions have an invalid data structure, log an error and no nothing else.

Alternative 2:
If the transaction tries to add an already existing Collectible, log an error and do nothing else.
